One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nGordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nWhich of the following could Gordon's test show?\nA. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nB. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nC. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour"

After two weeks, Dakota counted the number of seedlings that grew in each pot. She compared the number of seedlings in the pots with fertilizer to the number of seedlings in the pots without fertilizer.\nFigure: tomato seedlings growing in soil.\nIdentify the question that Dakota's experiment can best answer.\nA. Do more tomato seedlings grow when they are planted in soil with fertilizer compared to soil without fertilizer?\nB. Does the humidity level where tomato seeds are planted affect the number of tomato seedlings that grow?"

She wanted to design a new turbine that would produce 10% more electricity than older wind turbines. She thought that a turbine made from lightweight material would turn more easily and produce more electricity. So, Rose created a computer model of a turbine made from lightweight material. Then she used the model to calculate how much more electricity the new turbine could produce compared to the older turbines.\nFigure: studying a wind turbine computer model.\nWhich of the following could Rose's test show?\nA. if the new turbine could turn easily\nB. whether the new turbine could produce 10% more electricity\nC. how much the new turbine would weigh"

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nRobert was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Robert put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nWhich of the following could Robert's test show?\nA. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nB. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nC. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour"

Jellyfish and sea anemone, for example, are both part of the phylum Cnidaria. Cnidaria comes from a Greek word that means \"nettle,\" a stinging type of plant. Cnidarians are known for the tentacles that surround their mouths, which they use to sting and capture prey. All species that belong in the Cnidaria phyla live exclusively in the ocean.\nAnother phylum of invertebrates found only in oceans is the Echinodermata, a term that comes from Greek words meaning \"spiny\" and \"skin.\" Echinoderms, members of this phylum, have stiff bodies and often have stiff, sharp spines covering their skins.

Then, he rinsed and dried the penny, and repeated the test using water mixed with hand soap. He repeated these trials on nine additional pennies. Ivan compared the average number of pure water drops to the average number of water drops mixed with hand soap that he could add to a penny before the water spilled over.\nFigure: a dome of water on the surface of a penny.\nIdentify the question that Ivan's experiment can best answer.\nA.

These grasses crowded out other plants. Dr. Spencer thought that she could use fire to remove the unwanted grasses and allow other plants to grow. But she didn't know how often the prairie should be burned.\nDr. Spencer marked off six plots within a large area of the prairie. She used carefully controlled fires to burn all of the plants in each plot. She burned three of the plots once a year for three years. She burned the other three plots twice a year for three years. A year after the last fire, Dr. Spencer counted the number of unwanted grasses in each of the six plots.\nHint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating.

He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Ernest put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nWhich of the following could Ernest's test show?\nA. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\nB. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nC. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour"

Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.\n\nMuscle movement is controlled by charged atoms called ions. Ions move in and out of muscle cells through tube-like structures called channels.\nOne of these channels is made from the chloride channel protein. The chloride channel protein is encoded by the CLCN1 gene.\nA certain person had a mutation in the CLCN1 gene. Compared to the CLCN1 gene without a mutation, the mutated CLCN1 gene encoded a form of the chloride channel protein with a different structure.\nThis different form of the chloride channel protein allowed fewer ions than normal to travel through it. The person with the mutation had muscles that were slow to relax, which resulted in muscle stiffness. Having muscle stiffness due to a mutation in the CLCN1 gene is called Thomsen disease.\nFigure: muscles in the human body.\nComplete the sentence.\nThe mutation in the () affected the structure and function of the ().\nA. chloride channel protein . . .

For example, a dog will naturally salivate at the smell of food (an unconditioned response). However, if a dog learns that the sound of a ringing bell is a sure sign that dinner is coming, it will begin to react to the sound of that bell the same way it reacts to the smell of food (a conditioned response). This is called classical conditioning.\nOperant conditioning is a process like classical conditioning. However, in classical conditioning, the events that an animal learns to associate are not under the animal's voluntary control. In operant conditioning, an external event that is either a reward or punishment becomes linked with a voluntary behavior. For example, a student who receives a gold star for sitting quietly is more likely to choose to sit quietly in the future. The behavior (sitting quietly) has become linked in the student's mind with the reward that it produced in the past. Animal trainers rely on operant conditioning to encourage desired behaviors and discourage unwanted ones.\nWhich term matches the picture?\nA. operant conditioning\nB. classical conditioning"

Indeed, researchers believe that the relationship between cats and humans goes back to prehistoric times. But throughout history, different cultures and people around the world have had different sentiments about cats. Such feelings have ranged from fear to worship.\nPeople probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East. Farmers were growing and storing grain, which in turn attracted mice and other pests. Cats were wild then. However, they were likely drawn to farming communities because there were mice to hunt. The farmers would have noticed and appreciated these visitors. To keep the cats around, these early farmers may have given food and even shelter to the wild cats. The farmers and cats probably helped one another.\nIt wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way.\nLater in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night. The connection between witches and black cats lasted for many years. The idea traveled from Europe to North America as Europeans settled there. However, today cats of all colors are beloved by millions of people worldwide. In fact, the way some house cats are treated now might make their Egyptian ancestors jealous!\nBased on clues in the text, why would farmers have appreciated cats eight thousand years ago?\nA. The cats were thought to be visiting goddesses.\nB. The cats hunted and brought food to the farmers.\nC. The cats helped keep the farmers' grain free of mice.\nD. The cats helped farmers find better places to store grain."

She read that giving the bacteria more nutrients could affect the amount of insulin they produced. So, Kathleen gave extra nutrients to some of the bacteria. Then, she measured how much insulin those bacteria produced compared to bacteria that did not get extra nutrients.\nFigure: studying bacteria in a laboratory.\nWhich of the following could Kathleen's test show?\nA. whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin\nB. whether producing more insulin would help the bacteria grow faster\nC. whether different types of bacteria would need different nutrients to produce insulin"

He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Sebastian put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nWhich of the following could Sebastian's test show?\nA. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nB. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\nC. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour"

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nMason was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Mason put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nWhich of the following could Mason's test show?\nA. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nB. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nC. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour"

To make the concrete, they mixed together dry cement powder, gravel, and water. Then, they checked if each batch was firm enough using a test called a slump test.\nThey poured some of the fresh concrete into an upside-down metal cone. They left the concrete in the metal cone for 30 seconds. Then, they lifted the cone to see if the concrete stayed in a cone shape or if it collapsed. If the concrete in a batch collapsed, they would know the batch should not be used.\nFigure: preparing a concrete slump test.\nWhich of the following could Tara and Rosanne's test show?\nA. if the concrete from each batch took the same amount of time to dry\nB. if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use"

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nKenji was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Kenji put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nWhich of the following could Kenji's test show?\nA. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nB. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nC. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour"

Cats meow to talk with their humans!\nIf you are a cat owner, you may be interested in understanding your cat's meows. Different meows can have distinct meanings. A short, high squeak or chirp is a cheerful hello. A louder and longer meow is a cat's way of saying \"Please?\" or \"Let me out!\" An even longer and louder meow is your cat's way of demanding something, like \"Food!

In recent years, researchers have paid more attention to animal \"languages,\" and they have made some surprising discoveries. Egyptian fruit bats, for example, have a very complex way of talking to one another. In fact, they are one of the few animals that direct their calls to another individual. Most animals make calls to their entire group. Bats can also share more complex information than other animals. This is because they have special sounds to communicate specific issues.\nResearchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel wanted to learn more about what bats are really saying to one another. First, scientist Yossi Yovel and his team recorded sound and video of twenty-two bats. Fifteen thousand bat calls were collected over a period of seventy-five days. Then, the researchers tried to match each bat call with a behavior. They used special software to help them tell different bat calls apart and decipher the bats' messages.\nWhat Yovel and his team found was astonishing. Egyptian fruit bats are not just making squeaky noises; they are expressing very distinct concerns. One type of call means the bats are arguing over food. Another type of call means the bats are figuring out where they are going to sleep. A third call is used when one bat has gotten too close to another.\nThe researchers made another startling discovery. A bat can alter the sound of its call when addressing different members of the group. This is similar to how humans may use a different tone of voice when speaking to different people. It turns out that bats use language as a way to communicate their needs to each other, almost like humans do.\nBased on the text, how are fruit bats different from most other animals?\nA. They can communicate with many kinds of animals.\nB. They can communicate about specific problems.\nC. They can understand some human speech."

He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Duncan put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nWhich of the following could Duncan's test show?\nA. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\nB. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nC. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour"

Read the passage and think about the variables that are described.\n\nKamal noticed that some of the footballs his team used during practice were not fully inflated. He wondered whether fully inflated footballs would travel farther than footballs with a lower air pressure.\nTo find out, Kamal collected 20 standard footballs. He fully inflated ten of them to an air pressure of 13 pounds per square inch. He inflated the remaining ten to an air pressure of 10 pounds per square inch. Kamal used to launch a ball across a football field. He measured the distance the football traveled and then launched the next ball. Kamal repeated this with all 20 balls.\nHint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating.

He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Manny put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nWhich of the following could Manny's test show?\nA. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nB. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nC. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour"
